Darling,
I never knew what love is before meeting you,
I love being with you and cannot imagine a world without you in it,
I don't have words to tell you how happy I am when we are together.
You have been the guiding light that lit the way whenever I was lost.
Each morning, I thank God that you have been a part of my life.
And you are the reason I bounce out of bed because I know that I will get to see or talked to you during the day.
I promise that I will always love you and keep you close to my heart.
I will love you no matter where life ends up taking us.
You are my soul mate, and I cannot live without you.

Yours Forever
