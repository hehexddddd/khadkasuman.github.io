I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have found you.
You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel; I am bound to you with a strong attachment.
I think you are good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart;
it leans to you, draws you to my center and spring of life, wraps my existence about you—and,
kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one. – Charlotte Brontë

I just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you. 
Thank you for everything you’ve done for me. 
Thank you for loving me and accepting me unconditionally and providing me with undivided love and attention. 
You’ve been there for me through everything. 
Thank you for helping me grow into the woman I have become.

----------------
You have inspired me to be the best version of myself. 
I am grateful for all the laughs we’ve shared and the great times we have had. 
You’ve always been my strength in tough times and the sunshine when it’s cloudy outside. 
You have brought so much light into my life. You make everything else feel meaningless because 
the only thing that matters is you. You’re my soulmate and I love you so much. 
You are love of my life. Without you, I don’t know what I would do. 
Together, we have created a beautiful world.
