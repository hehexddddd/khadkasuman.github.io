Darling,
I never knew what love is before meeting you,
I love being with you and cannot imagine a world without you in it,
I don't have words to tell you how happy I am when we are together.
You have been the guiding light that lit the way whenever I was lost.
Each morning, I thank God that you have been a part of my life.
And you are the reason I bounce out of bed because I know that I will get to see or talked to you during the day.
I promise that I will always love you and keep you close to my heart.
I will love you no matter where life ends up taking us.
You are my soul mate, and I cannot live without you.

Yours Forever

Baby,
You were all that I needed to truly feel complete.
You have made my life so colorful.
Sometimes I look at you and think to myself "How lucky could I possibly be, to have you?"
There was this feeling of inexplicable joy in my heart and I knew it at that moment 
that I needed to tell you just how much I love you.
I am not a writer, and may not know the best way and the best words to use.
All I do know is that I love you and that I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
You have given me so much joy and unconditional love that 
I am quite sure that I am the luckiest man on this Earth.

Hello Gorgeous!
You were already on my mind when I woke up in the morning today. Well, let me tell you, baby, you are on my mind 24/7. 
Whenever I look at you, I see so many things just in a gaze. 
In you, I see a partner for life. You are the one whom I need by my side. 
No matter, the times are good or bad, I want you by my side. 
You are the person who shares my joys, my sorrows, and my dreams. 
I can't express how I feel whenever I wrap my arms around you. 
My happiness is just about being near to you. I Love You!

Hugs and Kisses
