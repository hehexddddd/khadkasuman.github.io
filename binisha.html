  > Date: April 19, 2019 <br/>Hey Binisha, How are you? <br />
  I feel like this is when I should tell you how much I miss you, but a part of
  me knows you probably don’t care. If you did, we’d probably still be
  friends…right? But I still hope you think of me on occasion and miss me too.
  It’s been months since we last talked—who would’ve seen that coming? I know I
  definitely didn’t.<br /> So much has happened since we last spoke, and I’ve wanted
  you to know it all. Isn’t that twisted? Even though we’re no longer friends, I
  still want to tell you all the things I used to. And it sucks because you’re
  not that person to me anymore. You were the one person I was supposed to be
  able to count on for anything. You used to be a phone call away—but suddenly
  you stopped answering. You were supposed to always look out for me—but then
  you were talking behind my back. We were supposed to be friends forever—but
  the next thing I knew, we were growing further and further apart. But I guess
  that’s life. Nothing is constant and no one owes you anything. And even though
  we’re not friends anymore, I still want to thank you. Thank you for being my
  close friend—and dealing with everything that comes with that. Thank you for
  the nights we stayed up til dawn just talking and laughing. Thank you for
  being honest and genuinely caring about me. Thank you for taking me for me,
  and never letting other’s judgments get in the way.  And thank you, thank you, thank
  you for being the friend I needed during that part of my life. <br />And even
  though we are no longer friends, I just want you to know that I could never
  hate you. Trust me, I’ve tried. It sounds awful, but I thought it would be
  easier to get over losing you if I could hate you—but I couldn’t bring myself
  to do it. I was hurt when you changed, but I will never hate you. You were my
  close friend. And despite how things ended up, because of that, I will always
  love you. <br/> And whenever I see something that
  reminds me of you or an inside joke, I almost always almost send it to you. I
  don’t think there will ever be a day when you don’t cross my mind at least
  once, but the sadness and hurt are fading, and I’m learning to look at you as
  a cherished memory. Everyone chooses their paths in life, and I guess your
  path just no longer intertwined with mine. But I hope you’re happy. Because I
  really do wish you the close. I hope you’ve found someone new to send all those
  weird memes too, to stay up on the phone with on the nights you just can’t
  sleep, to talk about FRIENDS with, and to equally complain and celebrate
  about all the things with. Just know that I don’t hate you and that I’ll
  always love you. Know that I cherish the memories we made and wouldn’t trade
  them for anything. I’ll always check your snaps and Facebook posts to make
  sure you’re doing ok, because some things will never change. And know that
  even if I don’t go up to you the next time I see you, I will always be
  grateful to have called you my close friend. Love Always, Your Ex-close
  Friend </code
